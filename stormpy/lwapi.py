		url - the url of the storm on demand api. This is for testing and development purposes, and won't need to be changed for normal usage.

		verify - whether the SSL certificate for the api should be verified (a bool). Defaults to True. This is primarily for testing. The public api should *always* have a valid SSL certificate!
